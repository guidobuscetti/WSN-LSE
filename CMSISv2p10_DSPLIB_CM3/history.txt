History of updates to CMSISv2p10_DSPLIB_CM3
===========================================

29 September 2011
-----------------
Fixed assembler configuration so that library is built correctly for Cortex-M3 rather
than Cortex-M4. Note that this is really for consistancy as the DSPLIB is actually 
written in C.
